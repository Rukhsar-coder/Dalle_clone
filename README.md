# Build a Full Stack MERN AI Image Generation App | Midjourney & DALL-E Clone

Welcome to our project! In this repository, we have built a full-stack application using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack along with AI image generation capabilities inspired by OpenAI's DALL-E model. This project showcases our journey in creating an innovative solution for image generation.

## Overview

Our project aims to revolutionize the way images are generated using artificial intelligence. With the power of MERN stack and DALL-E model, we have developed a web application that allows users to create unique and imaginative images based on their inputs.

## Features

- **AI Image Generation**: Utilize the cutting-edge DALL-E model to generate realistic and imaginative images.
- **Full Stack Development**: Implement a complete MERN stack solution, including MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure seamless user experience across different devices with a responsive and intuitive UI.
